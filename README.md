# Dat Night name tag

*This was part of the workshop at the first ever Dat Night in Portland, Ore. on November 29, 2018 âœ¨*

This is based on the site you get when you add a new site in Beaker. It comes ready to go!

Directions
1. Make an editable copy of this site in Beaker Browser.
2. Customize your site! You can do this right in Beaker Browser. If you prefer to do it in a text editor, set a local working directory for the site and open it that way.
3. Complete the name tag with your name, any links to social media and projects that you'd like to share, and answer the question "why are you excited about the peer to peer web?" You can change the background, color of your nametag, and symbol on your nametag by clicking the buttons at the bottom. If you're more comfortable with HTML, CSS, or JS, go ahead and make any changes that you want to! Note that as you work Beaker is tracking your changes.
